Download "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers" and extract. Can't be any other versions.

Open Eclipse.

Might need to install newest JDK (1.7) if it doesn't run.

In Eclipse:
	Help > Install New Software... > add the following:
		"http://download.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/WB/release/R201109201200/3.7/"
	Check "Swing Designer" and "Windows Builder Engine (Required)", and install them.
	
	Restart after installing plugin.
	
	File > Import > Import Existing Project > choose svn\eclipse folder and import three projects (client shared server)
	
	Menu: Project > Clean > Clean All
	
	Right click on server > Run As > Java application. Do the same for client.

Test if WindowBuilder installed properly:
	Find client/src/org.ece456.proj.gui.main/MainView.java
	
	Right click > open with > WindowBuilder Editor
	
	At the bottom of the editor screen, click on "Design" tab
