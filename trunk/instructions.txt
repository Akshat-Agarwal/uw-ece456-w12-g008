Download "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers" and extract. Can't be any other versions.

Open Eclipse.

Might need to install newest JDK (1.7) if it doesn't run.

In Eclipse:
	Help > Install New Software... > add the following:
		"http://download.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/WB/release/R201109201200/3.7/"
	Check "Swing Designer" and "Windows Builder Engine (Required)", and install them.
	
	Restart after installing plugin.
	
	File > Import > Import Existing Project > choose svn\eclipse folder and import the project "ece456"
	
	Run MainApplicationWindow, see if it runs.

Test if WindowBuilder installed properly:
	Open src/org.ece456.proj.gui.main/MainApplicationWindow.java
	At the bottom of the editor screen, click on "Design" tab
